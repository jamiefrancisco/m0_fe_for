# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

*I'm feeling a decent level of understanding but the syntax required for some of the exercises (like string interpolation) is quite confusing and it took me a while to work it out even with examples*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

*It felt great actually. I did productively struggle through getting the code to work as I wanted but I had no issue finding the resources I needed. The hardest part was fully understanding what my code meant*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

*I will be spending some time this weekend practicing for loops and how to properly print elements from arrays*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

*I wasn't confident in my understanding of the instructions for the second challenge in the for.js file. I'm wondering if my output is the correct output.*
